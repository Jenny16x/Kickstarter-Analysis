# Louise-Kickstarter-Analysis
Analysis on Kickstarters Data trends

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

##### The outcomes based on the launch date did show that successful rate is higher on certain months throughout the years. The biggest spike in the outcomes in during the month of June. December had the least successful outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### The success rate shows that the lower the the goal, the higher the success rate is. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### The most challenging part for me was when I did not know how to use the excel magic and copied and paste a lot of the formulas and that caused a lot of typos and I kind of went down the rabbit hole trying to find out why my numbers were coming back different. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### The highest success rate is during the month of June and lowest is the month of December based on the launch date from all previous events.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

#### I conclude that Louise had set too high of goal amounts which lead to high failed outcomes.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

#### Maybe Louise can include more details on the event such as locations, the type of location, or how it was promoted.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create outcomes based on country and outcomes based on staff picks.
