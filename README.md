## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

### The most challenging part for me was when I did not know how to use the excel magic and copied and paste a lot of the formulas and that caused a lot of typos and I kind of went down the rabbit hole trying to find out why my numbers were coming back different.

## Results

### The highest success rate is during the month of June and lowest is the month of December based on the launch date from all previous events. I conclude that Louise had set too high of goal amounts which lead to high failed outcomes.
